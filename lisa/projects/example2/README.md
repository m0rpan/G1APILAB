# Example 2
# Coconut species
This example is from the _trefle.io_ website. It filters out all the coconut species. The example shows a list of all the coconut species in the trefle data-base. The list contains the species common name. Here is the link to the example: https://https://docs.trefle.io/docs/examples/snippets/#get-search-for-coconut-species

To be able to finish this example I took help from Peter Tolstrup lectures and the coding train's module "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" from youtube. I also received help from my group mates, especially Alva.
