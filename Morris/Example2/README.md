# Example2
## different species of coconuts
 
I have built my experiment on one of the snippets (https://docs.trefle.io/docs/examples/snippets) at _trefle.io_ website for retrieving plants that have red flowers. 
To build this program I have referenced The Coding Trains playlist "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" on youtube together with help from my groupmates.
 
## Installation
For this API you need to install the dependencies required to run the site. 
This is how you do it in VS CODE:
1. Open terminal
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_  
 
It's necessary to have a personal token to be able to use this API. You can get a personal token by creating an account on [trefle.io](https://trefle.io/) webbsite. 
 
## How To Use
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to _Morris/Example1_
3. start the server by typing _node index.js_
4. Open you browser and typ _http://localhost:3000/_

 
## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This project was created by Morris Ahlstrand from Group 1, IDB20 at Malm√∂ University.  
I have built my experiment with the help of Peter Tolstrup Aagesen, my groupmates Alva, Lisa and Inotilla and the YouTube channel _the coding train_ and the examples from Trefle.io.
