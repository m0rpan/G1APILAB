# This project

this project is for users who want to get plants that thrive in their homes environment.
Its is a combination of work from Alva, Lisa, Morris, and Inotila's Spot.On group assignment. We have all made different projects that would serve as different sections of the devices functionality as seen during our presentation at the end of the course. I focused on the infromation part of the project.
