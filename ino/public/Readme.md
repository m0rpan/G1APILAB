## Zone distribution attempt
This was for a group assigment, of which we were doing some implementation. Our project a device that measures sunlight, humidity and temperature. And once the device has read this data it would recommened a plant based on this data. To contibute to my group, i tried to use a trefel api to determine the zones distrubition of the plant as i thought this would be usefull for insight(our device also has a information section about the plant). Sadly, I did not get mine to work properly.

## Why the project is useful 
This was a learning experince on what work goes in to being a designer and a hardcore lesson on programming.

## Installation 
To open the prototypes you have to:
1. Download Node.js
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_

## How to use
1. Open the terminal for the prototype you want to test
2. Type _node index.js_
3. Search in your browser _localhost:3000_ 
4. Test the prototype

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This individual effort was by Ino, with  the guidence of my peers(Alva, Lisa, & Morris) and a lot of youtbue videos. this was intended for the great grop project which, "was created by Alva, Lisa, Morris and Inotila from group 1 in the Interaction Design program. 
We have built our project with the help of Peter Tolstrup Aagesen, the YouTube channel _the coding train_ and the examples from Trefle.io. "
