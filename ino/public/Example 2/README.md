# Group 1 API assignment
Created different prototypes that are relevant to our project. The project is a two-piece device that measures sunlight, humidity and temperature. Depending on what value the devices gathers the user will see plants on the screen that are suitable for the environment the user put the device in. The other part of the device also measures sunlight, humidity and temperature, but is also portable. The main use for the smaller device is to scan plants in a plant store and thereby gets a response if it is suitable or not. 

## Why the project is useful 
Through the different prototypes we get to test the experience of our project. This project has also been useful to see if our concept is possible to construct and has given us insights to how it could be constructed 

## Installation 
To open the prototypes you have to:
1. Download Node.js
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_

## How to use
1. Open the terminal for the prototype you want to test
2. Type _node index.js_
3. Search in your browser _localhost:3000_ 
4. Test the prototype

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This project was created by Alva, Lisa, Morris and Inotila from group 1 in the Interaction Design program. 
We have built our project with the help of Peter Tolstrup Aagesen, the YouTube channel _the coding train_ and the examples from Trefle.io.
