# Example1 
## Plant gebus
 
I used the the data from  _trefle.io_ . In this example I am retrieving the genus of the  common name of their plants that they have in their data base. this is so that the users can have more info about their plant 
To build this program I used the example from the entire module of the The Coding Trains playlist "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" on youtube as well as insights passed on by my groupmates.
 
## Installation
For this API you need to install the dependencies required to run the site. 
This is how you do it in VS CODE or any other similar program:
1. Open terminal,e.g. powershell
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_  
 
To use this API you have to have a personal token. Creating an account on [trefle.io](https://trefle.io/) website gets you a to a token. 
 
## How To Use
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to _ino/Example1_
3. start the server by typing _node index.js_ or instal nodemon to not have to refresh everytime
4. Open you browser and typ _http://localhost:3000/_
