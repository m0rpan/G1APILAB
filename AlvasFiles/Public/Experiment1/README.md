# Experiment 1
# Plant species with the hight between 5cm and 20cm

I have bulit my experiment on an example from _trefle.io_ webbsite that filters out plant species with the hight between 5cm and 20cm. You can find this example [here](https://docs.trefle.io/docs/examples/snippets#get-species-with-height-between-5cm-and-20cm). 
With the data I have gatherd from the API I have taken the plants common name and put them in a list.  
I have taken help from The Coding Train's "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" youtube playlist when building this project. 

## Installation
For this API you need to install the dependencies required to run the site. 
This is how you do it in VS CODE:
1. Open terminal
2. Open the current enviroment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_  

It's nessesary to have a personal token to be able to use this API. You can get a personal token by creating an account on [trefle.io](https://trefle.io/) webbsite. 

## How To Use
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to _AlvasFils_
3. start the server by typing _node index.js_
4. Open you browser and typ _http://localhost:3000/_
5. Click on the example/prototype you want to visit
