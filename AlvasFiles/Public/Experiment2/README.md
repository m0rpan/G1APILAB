# Experiment 2
## Plant species with the minimum temperature between 5째C & 30째C
 
I have built my experiment on an [filtering-guide](https://docs.trefle.io/docs/guides/filtering) at _trefle.io_ website, I have used the example of "Filter on range" to make the API filter out plant species that has a minimum temperature between 5째C & 30째C. I have taken the common name, the image, and the minimum & maximum temperature from the data and printed that to the document. 
I have taken help from The Coding Train's "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" youtube playlist when building this project. 
 
## Installation
For this API you need to install the dependencies required to run the site. 
This is how you do it in VS CODE:
1. Open terminal
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_  
 
It's necessary to have a personal token to be able to use this API. You can get a personal token by creating an account on [trefle.io](https://trefle.io/) webbsite. 
 
## How To Use
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to _AlvasFils_
3. start the server by typing _node index.js_
4. Open you browser and typ _http://localhost:3000/_
5. Click on the example/prototype you want to visit
 
## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This project was created by Alva from group 1 in the Prototyping coarse. 
I have built my experiment with the help of Peter Tolstrup Aagesen, the YouTube channel _the coding train_ and the examples from Trefle.io.
