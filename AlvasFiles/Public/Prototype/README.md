# Prototype
## Trying out functionality of the portable device of On.Point project
This prototype shows the user, after making a choice of plant, if it suits the condition or not. With this prototype we can test the experience of choosing a plant first and getting the suitability confirmation after. This is, in the big picture, how our concept of our small portable device in our On.Point project would function. 
 
## What I have based my project on
I have build my prototype on an [filtering-guide](https://docs.trefle.io/docs/guides/filtering) at _trefle.io_ website, I have used the example of "Excluding null value" to make the API filter out plant species that does not have a minimum temperature value. I do this so that user will not have the possibility to click on a plant that would not be able to compare the min temperature and the input value. I have also used my code from experiment 2 to build this prototype. 
 
I have taken help from The Coding Train's "Working with Data and APIs in JavaScript" youtube playlist when building this project. 
 
## Installation
For this API you need to install the dependencies required to run the site. 
This is how you do it in VS CODE:
1. Open terminal
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type _npm install_  
 
It's necessary to have a personal token to be able to use this API. You can get a personal token by creating an account on [trefle.io](https://trefle.io/) webbsite. 
 
## How To Use
1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to _AlvasFils_
3. start the server by typing _node index.js_
4. Open you browser and typ _http://localhost:3000/_
5. Click on the example/prototype you want to visit
 
## Who maintains and contributes to the project
This project was created by Alva from group 1 in the Prototyping coarse. 
I have built mt prototype with the help of Peter Tolstrup Aagesen, the YouTube channel _the coding train_ and the examples from Trefle.io.
